# Some (but not all!) of the settings support randomization via the factory

# Output control
#
# IMPORTANT: log file output is currently unsupported because I spent the 
# better part of a day trying to get Python to synchronize file output
# (to avoid out-of-order write operations), and failed.
# Yes, I tried threading.Lock.
# Yes, I also tried multiprocessing.Lock.
# Yes, I tried requiring the acquisition of *both* types of Lock before
# proceeding.
# Yes, I tried explicitly calling flush() on the file object.
# Yes, I tried building a buffer for file output that was monitored by 
# a separate thread and flushed to disk periodically.
# Yes, I tried requiring acquisition of both Lock types before updating 
# the buffer *and* writing to disk.
# No, none of this prevented write operations from conflicting and 
# writing out-of-order data to disk and/or overwriting data in memory 
# before it could be written to disk.
# This mainly appeared in debug/verbose output mode, so it's probably 
# related to very high-frequency operations.
# I am not going to incorporate a nonstandard library just to make this 
# work the way file output and thread-locking should.

# Quasi-chunking settings
# 
# some TCP clients (*cough*SCPonMacOS*cough*) have fragile sockets that are easily
# overloaded. Sending e.g. 2MB (or even 128K, in some cases) of data all at once will 
# cause those clients to fail.
#
# Symptoms include e.g.:
# - SCP clients reporting "Corrupted MAC on input. Disconnecting: Packet corrupt"
# - rdesktop audio extremely stuttery, "Fooo!" on stdout
#		note: this will still happen to some extent (even if connecting directly 
#		instead of over an ABPTTS tunnel) if the throughput is too low, but most 
#		of the audio should make it through.
#
# These settings control the quasi-chunking mechanism I implemented to work around 
# this problem, where large blocks are split into smaller ones for relay to the 
# client.
#
# Most TCP client software I tested works fine without this mechanism, but I like 
# to default to the most reliable configuration, especially because losing a tunnel 
# connection during a pen test is extremely frustrating.
#
# Increasing the block size can measurably improve throughput if the client software
# / OS is capable of handling it.

# 81920		success most of the time
# 98304		consistent failure

#
# maximum number of bytes to return to the client component in each send/receive operation
# this value is the option which most directly affects the latency/throughput tradeoff of 
# the tunnel. 
# For example, a relatively low value like 32768 will ensure low enough latency
# even over a relatively slow connection (IE the internet) to keep e.g. MacOS 
# SCP happy with the connection, but the throughput will be reduced
# significantly. (approximately 1/7th the throughput versus no cap on this 
# value).
# On the other hand, while high values will result in significantly increased 
# throughput (making e.g. streaming video over a Windows Remote Desktop practical in 
# some cases), the latency of the connection becomes much higher as well, 
# especially over a slower connection. During testing, this did not cause 
# issues for tunnels over a LAN, but over the internet, the delay due to 
# downloading the extremely large HTTP responses from the server did introduce 
# reliability issues with the connection.
# recommendation: use a small value such as 32768 unless you are connecting over 
# a LAN, in which case you can consider increasing to e.g. 6553600
